I am undertaking a PhD in Computational (Medicinal) Chemistry in the Daniel Cole group at Newcastle University, and my project is focused on developing automated workflows for computer-aided drug design (CADD) by utilising and integrating molecular dynamics and structural biology software, for fragment hit-to-lead optimisation. This sort of automation will utilise Python and be validated using specific targets (CDK9, SARS-CoV-2 - NSP13). The new workflow will allow non-specialists to access CADD more readily, and for specialists, automate laborious preparatory work.

I hold a MChem degree in Chemistry, specialising in computational chemistry, from St. Chad's College at Durham University. My thesis was on simulation models of bent-core liquid crystals. I am currently a PhD student at Newcastle University with Molecular Science for Medicine (MoSMed), 

I also have a strong interest in the philosophy of science.
